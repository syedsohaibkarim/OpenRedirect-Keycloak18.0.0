# OpenRedirect-Keycloak18.0.0
An open redirection vulnerability (open redirect) happens when attackers are able to control where a website or application redirects users. Here in this case, we can mention any URL as value of redirect_uri and it successfully redirects to it.


**Impact.** By exploiting the open redirect vulnerability on the keycloak using the URL parameter value 'redirect_uri', the attacker is redirecting the victim to http://attacker.com/phish
